## Problem:

Model a shoe with NURBS.

## Solution:

This mostly boiled down to the usage of the EP curve tool, manipulating control vertices with the translate, scale, and rotate tools, lofts, and birails. For the stiletto, I also extracted a curve from the isoparm at the back of the shoe in order to create a new closed loop, which I lofted and attached to a cylinder.
