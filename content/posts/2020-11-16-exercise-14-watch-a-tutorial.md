I watched "Introduction to Rigging in Maya 2017" by Eric Kunzendorf on Pluralsight ([tutorial link](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/maya-2017-rigging-introduction/table-of-contents)).

The most useful tool by far that I learned about was using MEL scripts, mentioned several times throughout. One of the more useful ones that I'm keeping are the scripts mentioned in [comet scripts](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=75bffa40-a293-445d-8e5f-7898214f74df "this video"), which add scripts for selecting hierarchies and orienting joints. A later video also included a script for making control curves, which while rather simple, is still something I found useful.

Something that I ultimately didn't use, but think I will make use of in the future if I end up doing more complicated rigs, is the use of separate skeletons -- a deformation skeleton and a joint skeleton -- as mentioned in section 3, starting with [skeletons](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=1ac38a2e-52b5-4f6c-ba6e-d8f0b4a06f23 "this video").

The most important thing I learned from the tutorial was in section four about the legs, feet, and shoulders, which was setting up inverse kinematics and setting up controls, like in [IK](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=0297a439-7e1a-4771-9f8b-ee4f52b279a4 "this video").
