## Problem:

Recreate a picture, creating models, shaders, and lighting from scratch.

## Solution:

It took a long while to pick a picture to use for this project. Searching for still life photography, for example, included vegetation in most of the results. Eventually I found this photo, which is from https://www.pexels.com/photo/black-padded-brown-wooden-chair-4067756/.

![Source image](/media/pr2-source.png "Source image")

The image depicts a chair in a room with a wood floor. There's two picture frames above it, one of which is slightly askew. Light shines in at an angle, but the room itself is still well-lit.

I decided to start with the chair, but I wasn't quite sure of the dimensions from other angles, so I did some searching. I found a chair that looks a lot like it at https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32814122240.html to use as a reference. I started with a cube for each separate part of the chair, and through a lot of extrusions, vertex manipulations, bevels, and perseverance, I got something that looks a lot like the chair.

For the wood part of the chair, I used spacetime noise stretched out on u to create some grain, and used a multiplication node to add in the color.

For the cushions, I mixed some fractal and billow noise together for the bump. I also fed the noise into a mult with the base color to get the final color. It took a while messing with the specular and sheen components of the shader to get a result that looked close to the original (it kept on ending up far too bright).

For both the wood back and seat of the chair I had to do a camera projection of the UV's to avoid distortion.

For the floor, I stretched out a block, beveled the edges, instanced it once to get another at an angle, and did a whole lot more instancing. Similar to the floor, I fed in stretched out spacetime noise, but I added a color jitter node set to object for the type to get variation in the floorboards.

![Floor instances](/media/pr2-instancing.png "Whole 'lotta instancing")

Like I said, a lot of instancing.

The back wall was simple enough (just a plane), and then I added another block along the bottom for a baseboard. Neither had anything fancy going on with the shader graph, but it took a bit of time to get the baseboard to look properly flat in color -- I ended up bumping diffuse roughness up all the way.

The picture frames were made from boxes scaled up as well. The frame material doesn't seem to reflect light -- they're nearly completely uniformly black -- so I reduced the specular to almost nothing.

The socket that's barely visible behind the chair was a pain, but I found a reference that looked like it was from the same room and used a bend deformer on a plane to start the front of one half of it, mirrored that half, and extruded it all back. A whole lot of edge loops and extrusions later, and I had something that resembled the original. Massive pain for something that's barely visible in the scene.

![Socket](/media/pr2-socket.png "Booleans may have been involved")

Booleans may or may not have been involved in the creation of this socket.

For the material, I had a lot of trouble getting the material to look right. I ended up using off-white for the base color, and a very light manilla for some subsurface scattering.

The room had a lot of ambient light, so I scaled up a large area light and placed it above.

![Lighting](/media/pr2-lighting.png "Lighting")

To get the highlight that streams in between the picture frames, I used a spotlight with a barndoor to control the beam and a globo to try to get closer to the source image. The barndoor was done through trial and error, since I couldn't find a way to represent the barndoor in the editor -- it had to be adjusted, rendered, and adjusted again to try to get closer to the source. I fed in a circular ramp and some billow noise to the globo.

Finally, for rendering, I used an aspect ratio of .67 and set up a camera with the same ratio, since the source image was vertical.

And here's a few other angles.
