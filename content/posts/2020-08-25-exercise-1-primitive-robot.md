## Problem:

Build a robot using only primitives and the basic translate, rotate, and scale tools.

## Solution:

For the start, I decided to work on the torso of the robot, unsure of what direction I'd take things. For this, I started with a horizontal cylinder, and then decided to build out the torso using cubes and stretching everything.

Following this, I immediately got the idea that an asymmetrical robot could be interesting visually. To accomplish this, I immediately decided on a giant and small arm, starting with the giant arm. I used torus and sphere primitives to create joints, and simple blocks to create the claws.

With all of this done, I thought it would be amusing to also prop the robot up on a small single leg atop a wheel, and finished it with a spherical head with a cone on top and a torus for the eye. The other arm is simple blocks with cones for fingers.
