## Problem:

Watch 10 videos on Pluralsight and give a brief description of what was learned in each.

## Solution:

I decided to watch the automotive modeling set of videos, since I figured that would be useful for our first project, since for the next exercise I'm using a toy car.

### Setting up Reference Images

The first video in the set was on setting up reference images from each view. I learned how to set up a view from each side properly distanced and scaled to be a good reference.

### Drawing Out the Wheel Arch

This video was about making the arches around the wheels, using reference images as a guide for how to modify the geometry.

### Connecting Wheel Arches to Create the Side

This video showed how to bridge the two arches that define a side, and manipulate the geometry to mirror the various edges and curvature of the side.

### Extruding up the Side of the Car

This video showed the process of using extrusions to extend up the side, making sure to add edges and manipulate vertices to match up with the reference photo. The idea is to work with low poly here and plan for future edits.

### Drawing Out the Side Panels

This video went over making the side panels. It gave some advice on how to ensure you have edges lined up with planned curvature and indentations.

### Extruding in the Door Scoop

This video covered how to bring in geometry to make things such as a door scoop. I learned that you can rotate an extrusion, which is actually something that I think I'm going to make use of.

### Bridging Across the a Pillar

The title is pretty explanatory on this one. It showed how to use bridges and extracted geometry to create the a pillar without making all of your geometry overly complex.

### Extruding Across the Top of the Car

This video shows where things start to become more complete across the vehicle, by adding the top of the vehicle. Here extrude is used to give thickness to the roof.

### Building Out the Front of the Car

Using extrudes and polygon appending this video built out the front of the car. I'm starting to get an idea of how to handle building up the geometry for something like this.

### Extruding the Hood

This video went over creating the hood of the car. I didn't really learn something new from this video, but it was informative to see how the tutorial handled it.
